###### I have reached a decision to offer some of common SQL scripts in this repository, sometimes basic scripts as create table and insert values into them, to help students who want to know and understand how DBMS work, get to know the difference between one and another, and obviously study SQL, so I am trying to make it easy, just clone this repository into your folder and paste the code into your local database and start to select ... from all you want! I hope u'all enjoy it :)
